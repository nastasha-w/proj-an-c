The `readEagle` code was written by [John Helly](https://github.com/jchelly/read_eagle),
and is included here for convenience, since the scripts in proj-an depend
on it to read in data from EAGLE and related codes. 

Stijn DeBackere wrote `read_bahamas_files.py`.


Installation and use
--------------------

readEagle_install has it's own README files for the installation of readEagle,
and the read_eagle_files python wrapper I use in the python wrapper for 
HsmlAndProject. The only thing to add is that, if you already have readEagle
installed, you can just put read_eagle_files.py somewhere in your PYTHONPATH
and it should work. (Mine is in the same directory as read_eagle, but modfied
versions in the same directory as make_maps_v3_master.py work fine as well.)

read_bahamas_files.py
was written by Stijn DeBackere to read in BAHAMAS snapshots. To use this, also
just put it in your PYTHONPATH after installing readEagle.

Installation notes for read_eagle on Cosma, galaxy (Leiden system), and OzStar 
are included. Installation on quasar (Leiden system) works the same as for 
galaxy. Please add any notes on how to install read_eagle on other systems.

The 2d projection wrapper should work as long as you have the appropriate 
read-in file installed for the simulation you want to use. Not having 
read_bahamas_files properly installed will not prevent you from working with 
the eagle simulations.
